sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on their battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield

I will be the source of your extinction
I will flood your hearts with terror and contempt
I will make you wish this day had never come
Laughing as you beg for death

Your greatest fears will be unleashed
The innocent will know eternal suffering
And all creation shall tremble
Before the darkness that will consume your world
