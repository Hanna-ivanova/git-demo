sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on their battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield

I will be the source of your extinction
I will flood your hearts with terror and contempt
I will make you wish this day had never come
Laughing as you beg for death

Fight
Kill them all
Fight with honor
Do not fall
Die
Take their heads
Don't stop
Till they all are dead
